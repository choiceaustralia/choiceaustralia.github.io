Demo code built for Mark Pesce's Panel at WWW2017 in Perth, Western Australia.

This very simple demostration of distilling down a length technical research paper
presented in Nature magazine into a simple web-based visualisation of the
conclusions. It was hacked together after a dinner conversation the night before
the panel to show how quickly something can be built. It's not pretty or well
structured, but an effective visualisation does not require large engineering
resources to pull it off.
